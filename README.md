# Machine_Learning_AZ - Udemy Certification

#### The following are some of the notes and projects that I worked on in this certification and most of the code that I share in GitHub can be used as templates or reference when working in tasks that involve machine learning. 

### Table of contents

| No|    Folder name      | Content description   |
| --| :------------------ |:--------------------- |
| 1 | Data Preprocessing  |  Files in Python and R that handles missing data, transforms categorical data into numerical data, applies simple feature scaling techniques and splits data into training and test sets. |
| 2 | Regression          | Files in Python and R that shows how to perform the different types of regression techniques in ML: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression.|
| 3 | Classification      | Files in Python and R that show how to perform the different types of classification techniques in ML: Logistic Regression, KNN-algorithm, Support Vector Machines, Kernel SVM (non linear problems), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification.    |
| 4 | Clustering      | Files in Python and R that show how to perform the different types of clustering techniques in ML: hierarchical clustering and k_means.  |
| 5 | Association Rule   | File in Python and 2 files R that show how to perform the Eclat and Apriori techniques.  |
| 6 | Reinforcement Learning      | Files in Python and R that show how to perform the different types of reinforcement learning techniques in ML: Thompson learning and Upper Confidence Bound.   |
| 7 | Natural Language Processing   | Files in Python and R that guide you to perform basic natural language processing techniques.  |
| 8 | Deep Learning      | Files in Python and R that show how to create an Artificial Neural Network and a file in Python that guide you to create a convolutionary neural network.  The files for the convolutionary neural network were not uploaded because it weights too much. |
| 9 | Dimensionality Reduction  | Files in Python and R that show how to apply the Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis techniques.   |
| 10 | Model Selection and Boosting  | Files in Python that show how to apply the tuning techniques of grid search and k_fold_cross_validation to find the best parameters in regression or classification methods.   |
